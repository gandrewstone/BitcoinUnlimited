## Introduction

OP_GROUP tokens are a method for implementing representative tokens -- also named "colored coins" within the bitcoin community.

OP_GROUP tokens differ in significant aspects from other existing or proposed "colored coins" techniques:

* Implemented as a single opcode within Bitcoin Cash's Script language.
	 + Integration with Script means that OP_GROUP functionality will grow as Script grows, and maintenance is minimal compared to colored coins that use "piggy-back" blockchains.

* Is miner validated
	 + Like BCH transactions, light wallets can rely on the idea that transactions committed some blocks behind the blockchain tip are valid

* Does not require knowledge of the blockchain history to determine token grouping
	 + Compatible with pruning and forthcoming UTXO commitment techniques

* Simple "light" wallet implementation
	 + Can use the same merkle proof technique (SPV or "simplified payment validation") used for transactions today.

* Can be enabled via soft fork
	+ Wallets do not need to add OP_GROUP functionality immediately.  Wallets that are not upgraded or choose not to support OP_GROUP will likely not recognise tokens sent to the wallet and cannot accidentally spend these tokens as BCH in "normal" scripts.

## The format of this document

This document uses the term **MUST** to indicate a rule that must be followed by all implementations.
The term **MAY** indicates optional functionality. However, if optional functionality is implemented it is highly recommended that be implemented as defined here for interoperability with other software.

*[This document places the "why" -- the discussion concerning the reasons and justifications of certain decisions -- in bracketed italics.  Text in italics is informative, not normative]*

For the purposes of discussion of this draft additional notes are contained throughout in marked "DISCUSSION" and formatted in bold brackets **[DISCUSSION: like this]**.  These are
intended to be removed from the final version of this document.


## Risks and philosophical approach

The purpose of OP_GROUP is to enable colored coins on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain and in SPV (phone) wallets, covering major use cases with a fraction of the development effort and maintenance of other token proposals.  These use cases include ICOs (initial coin offerings), representative tokens for stocks, bonds and currencies, and other uses I haven't considered.  But these use cases notably do not include "smart" contracts, since the introduction of a sophisticated programming language would add tremendous complexity and competes with the evolving Bitcoin Cash Script language.

This proposal also limits itself to exactly one opcode.  It is possible to include additional functionality via additional opcodes but I believe that the discussion and decision around these possible features should occur once OP_GROUP is successfully deployed and employed. 

## Definitions

* *GP2PKH* - Group pay to public key hash script.  Specifically: `<group id> <quantity> OP_GROUP OP_DROP OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <address> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`
* *GP2SH* - Group pay to script hash script.  Specifically: `<group id> <quantity> OP_GROUP OP_DROP OP_DROP OP_HASH160 <address> OP_EQUAL`
* *mint-melt address* - An address that can be used to mint or melt tokens.  This is actually the same number as the group identifier.
* *group identifier* - A number used to identify a group.  This is the same number as the group's mint-melt address, but it uses a cashaddr type of 2.
* *bitcoin cash group* - A special-case group that includes all transactions with no explicit group id.  This group represents the "native" BCH tokens during transaction analysis.
* *mint* - Move ungrouped satoshis into a group, thereby creating new tokens
* *melt* - Move tokens back to the native satoshis, thereby destroying existing tokens
* *UTXO* - Unspend Transaction Output: A record of current value on the bitcoin cash blockchain

## Theory of Operation

Please refer to [https://medium.com/@g.andrew.stone/bitcoin-scripting-applications-representative-tokens-ece42de81285](https://medium.com/@g.andrew.stone/bitcoin-scripting-applications-representative-tokens-ece42de81285).  This specification differs from this document slightly:
* It does not constrain 1 token to 1 satoshi. Instead both token quantity and group id are pushed onto the stack.
* It allows a group to have limited tokens by allowing a group to be created whose identifier is the hash of one of the transaction's inputs (COutPoint).

## Specification

As a soft fork, this specification is divided into 3 sections: miner (consensus) requirements, full node implementations, and wallet implementations

**[DISCUSSION: OP_GROUP can be triggered either via soft fork or hard fork.  If a hard fork is chosen, changes are minimal:  OP_GROUP would be assigned to a new opcode number, and OP_DROP would be removed. This saves a byte.  (Alternately, OP_DROP could be required as the next byte.  This would give us effectively 255 additional 16 bit opcodes: OP_GROUP.OP_XXX).  The advantage of a hard fork is that unupgraded light wallets would discard the transaction as bad (and hopefully indicate such to the user to reduce payment confusion in the case where someone accidentally pays a token rather than BCH).  Otherwise an unupgraded light wallet could be fed an illegal op_group transaction, but with a "normal" output that it understands.  The wallet would then accept this transaction from a 0-conf perspective.  Note that this not specific to op_group.  It is generally a vulnerability in the repurposing of OP_NOP to add functionality via soft fork.  The disadvantage of a hard fork is that all full nodes must upgrade]**

### Miner (Consensus) Requirements

#### Deployment
Miners **MUST** enforce OP_GROUP semantics after the May 2018 hard fork.

#### Retirement
Since this opcode may not exist inside a P2SH script, removal of this opcode is easier than other opcodes.  A "group stop" block height can be chosen where OP_GROUP balancing is no longer enforced by miners.  At that point OP_GROUP effectively becomes a no-op so all owners of OP_GROUP tokens may spend their UTXOs as normal BCH.  Issuers of tokens have until the group stop block to switch to another blockchain without interruption of their service.  Issuers may do so by importing the utxos marked by their group into a custom blockchain easily and without securing the signatures of all token owners.    When the group stop block occurs, OP_GROUP balances are effectively frozen although the underlying satoshis may now be spent.  So if an issuer has not created a custom blockchain, s/he may subsequently do so at any time by importing the utxos tagged with the relevant OP_GROUP address from the point of the group stop block. 

#### Validation

A new Script opcode **MUST** be created, named OP_GROUP and replacing OP_NOP7 (0xb6).

This opcode **MUST** behave as a no-op during script evaluation. It therefore may legally appear anywhere in a script. *[Its simpler and less error prone to let it appear anywhere and ignore it (as per the OP_NOP7 semantics today) than to add a consensus rule enforcing its proper appearance.  Having such a rule would be a place where implementation could fall out of consensus.  I believe that consensus rules should be minimal and be those that protect or enhance the monetary function of BCH.  Limiting extraneous appearances of OP_GROUP does neither]*

This opcode comes into play during transaction validation, and ensures that the quantity of input and outputs within every group balance.

First a *"mint-melt group"*, a *"single-mint group"* and a *"group identifier"* are identified for each input and output.

The *group identifier* is the token group that this input or output belongs to.  A *group identifier* is a data string of 20 or 32 bytes.  It is not a number (so no zero or sign extension is allowed).  A 19 byte group identifier is simply invalid.  Transactions that do not use OP_GROUP are put in a special group called "NoGroup" that designates the "native" BCH token.  "NoGroup" is a conceptual aid -- it will never be used outside your implementation.

Inputs may also have a *mint-melt group*, depending on their construction.  The *mint-melt group* indicates the ability to either mint or melt tokens into or from the corresponding group.  All inputs have a *single-mint group*.

Identification proceeds in the following manner:

**For all inputs:**

The mint-melt group and group identifier is the same as that of the "previous output" (specified in the input by its transaction id and index).
*[The prevout is already needed for script validation and transaction signing, and is located in the UTXO database so this backpointer adds no additional data storage requirements on nodes or wallets]*

The single-mint group is the double SHA256 of the input's serialized transaction id and vout index.

**For all outputs:**

To specify a *group identifier*, a script **MUST** begin with the following exact format:  `<20 or 32 byte group identfier> <1,2,4, or 8 byte unsigned little-endian quantity> OP_GROUP ...`.

In words, If a script begins with 0x14 or 0x20 (i.e. 20 or 32 byte data push opcodes), followed by data, followed by OP_GROUP, the *group identifier* is the data pushed.  This sequence **MUST** begin the script and there **MUST NOT** be other opcodes between the *group identifier* data push and the OP_GROUP instruction. 

If the script does not meet the above specification, its *group identifier* is "NoGroup".

*[It is necessary to identify the group without executing the script so the group cannot be located within conditional code.  The simplest solution is to put it first]*

If a script is a P2PKH, P2SH, or GP2PKH (group P2PKH) or GP2SH, the *mint-melt group* is the public key hash or script hash.  For complete clarity, these are the only scripts that have a *mint-melt group*:
> **P2PKH**: `OP_DUP  OP_HASH160  <mint-melt group>  OP_EQUALVERIFY  OP_CHECKSIG`

> **P2SH**: `OP_HASH160  <mint-melt group>  OP_EQUAL`

> **GP2PKH**: `<data>  OP_GROUP  OP_DROP  OP_DUP  OP_HASH160  <mint-melt group>  OP_EQUALVERIFY  OP_CHECKSIG`

> **GP2SH**: `<data>  OP_GROUP  OP_DROP  OP_HASH160  <mint-melt group>  OP_EQUAL`

As you can see, the mint melt group is another name for the script hash, and public key hash (for these scripts only).

*[It makes OP_GROUP operation much simpler if the mint-melt group can be identified without executing the script.  Therefore, we limit the mintable or meltable input transaction types to well-known script templates.  This does not limit functionality.  Tokens that exist in a nonstandard script can be minted or melted in 2 transactions by first sending them to an output that uses one of the above scripts, and then issuing the mint/melt transaction]*

If a script does not match one of the above templates, it **MUST** have no *mint-melt group*.

##### Transaction Validation algorithm

*[The algorithm below is described pedantically to make it easy to understand how it actually succeeds at balancing group inputs and outputs and how it correctly applies mint and melt coins.  It should be possible to write it much more succinctly -- for example, there is no need for an "input" field.  Instead, you could subtract the output field down to 0]*

Create a data structure (let's call it GroupBalances) that associates group identifiers with one boolean "mintableOrMeltable", and 2 Amounts "input" and "output".  Initialize these to false/0.

First we'll find the final quantity of tokens in every group.  We need this so we can match it with inputs to balance the transaction:

* For every transaction output (vout):
  * Identify its *group identifier* and *quantity*  If NoGroup, then continue.
  * Add the vout's *quantity* to the group's "output" field.

Next we go through every transaction input (vin) and add its value to the vin group's "input" field, in the same way we did for the output.  However, there is one caveat -- we need to identify whether the value of that input could be used as a mint or melt. In that case we add to the "mintable" or "meltable" field rather than the "input" field:


* For every transaction input (vin), find its *group identifier* and *quantity*, its *single-mint group*, and its *mint-melt group*:
  * If the *single-mint group* is in GroupBalances, mark "mintableOrMeltable" true
  * If the *mint-melt group* is in GroupBalances, mark "mintableOrMeltable" true
  * If the *group identifier* is valid (not NoGroup), add the *quantity* to "input"

* For every group in GroupBalances, compare the "input" to the "output":
  * If "mintableOrMeltable" is false and "input" != "output", FAIL

For an example implementation please refer to the CheckTokenGroup() function in this reference implementation:

### Full node Implementations

#### Remove Dust Threshold

Miners and full nodes should not require that a transaction exceed a "dust threshold" to be accepted and relayed if that transaction involves groups, since a single grouped satoshi may be worth a lot more than one satoshi.  The provided reference implementation removes the dust threshold entirely.  Attempts to determine the "value" of a transaction to the network as a whole and to only mine those transactions are full of problems.  Instead, if the transaction is valuable enough *to the issuer* he or she will pay a large enough fee for it to be relayed and mined.

*[The dust threshold was originally created for user-friendliness -- to stop outputs from being created that would cost more in fees to spend than they were worth.  But the recent spendability issues in Bitcoin proved that the dust threshold does not work for that purpose because the future coin price and minimum fee cannot be predicted.  From a user friendliness perspective, stopping tiny outputs is best done in the wallet, especially because the wallets today typically also get a price feed so they know how much that output is worth in fiat.]*

### Wallet Implementations

OP_GROUP is implemented as a soft fork so wallets do not need to do anything if they do not want to add token support.  But in that case, the wallet will not recognise the format of an OP_GROUP tagged transaction output script and ignore it.  This could cause user confusion if someone accidentally sends that user a token rather than BCH.  To avoid this, it is recommended that wallets identify OP_GROUP outputs and issue an alert if one is received.

*[since the bitcoin cash devs are contemplating adding quite a few new opcodes, this alert may be useful for more than just op_group]*

#### Group Identifier

Group identifiers are a 20 or 32 data bytes which are also bitcoin cash addresses.  Although addresses are 20 bytes today, in the future it is likely that P2SH scripts will be redefined to something like "OP_HASH256 [32-byte-hash-value] OP_EQUAL", so wallets should be prepared to accept 256 bit group identifiers.

Group identifiers displayed in cashaddr format **MUST** use the "type" byte as 2.  This results in a cashaddr prefix of "z" for example:
`bitcoincash:zrmn5e26cfkd0j97kx5jdm3jrrzv5l6a0upqxjxkw2`

#### JSON-RPC calls

It is recommended that all wallets with a JSON-RPC (bitcoin-cli) interface provide the same API so that applications built on top of this interface will work with different wallet implementations.

One new RPC is defined, named "token" that contains several sub-functions.  Parameters are similar for all sub-functions and are as follows:

**group id**  (*string*): The group identifier in cashaddr format.  This identifier is generated in the "token new" command.  All group identifiers have a "z" prefix.

**address**  (*string*): A bitcoin cash address.  Token addresses are interchangable with each other and BCH addresses, so use the standard "getnewaddress" RPC command to create one.  *[having the same addresses for multiple token types allows one to put different tokens in the same address.  This feature may have many uses, such as paying interest in BCH to token holders]*

**quantity** (large integer):  All functions express token quantities in single units.  This is different than the non-token API which expresses values as BCH or 100,000,000 Satoshi.



### RPC: "token new"

Create a new group (token type).  This operation is similar to "getnewaddress" in that no transactions are created.

**Syntax:**

token new

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "groupIdentifier": "<cashaddr format group id>",
  "controllingAddress": "<cashaddr format mint/melt address>"
}
```

**Example:**
```bash
$ ./bitcoin-cli token new
{
  "groupIdentifier": "bchreg:zzm4ufz5erpzphtxm5knllxyv9kwut8vnsjjrsfg48",
  "controllingAddress": "bchreg:qzm4ufz5erpzphtxm5knllxyv9kwut8vns4csw8w25"
}
```

### RPC: "token mint"

Create a certain number of tokens of a particular type and sends them to specified addresses.  Converts (redeems) tokens back into BCH.  You must be the owner of this group (have the ability to sign the controllingAddress) to successfully execute this function.

Depending on the implementation, you may need to manually load the group's controlling address with some BCH before calling this function.

**Syntax:**

`token mint <group id> <address> <quantity> [ <address> <quantity>...]`

**Returns:**

A transaction id (hex string) or list of transaction ids.

**Example:**
```bash
./bitcoin-cli token mint bchreg:zzm4ufz5erpzphtxm5knllxyv9kwut8vnsjjrsfg48 bchreg:qza38qklu2ztay60xaxl2wuhdzc5327p0ssaqjadz0 100000 bchreg:qpjal7uqcgqv7crjc3s2098ha4thv4z6es6fjnww35 50000
635243c3bc1f7b6f5f0dc0f3b5cd5aa82d483e9ec669f4e81b0c734bccb9c762
```

### RPC: "token send"

Send tokens to other addresses.

**Syntax:**

`token send <group id> <address> <quantity> [ <address> <quantity>...]`

**Returns:**

A transaction id (hex string).

**Example:**

```bash
./bitcoin-cli token send bchreg:zzm4ufz5erpzphtxm5knllxyv9kwut8vnsjjrsfg48 bchreg:qr4tj4zvfcmyjq55wmt4qcz0w27drzcmtcszn9xutz 42 bchreg:qrxqy0hjnjumjayf25sawvjkammspdeyxv8ejpe748 451
```

### RPC: "token melt"

Converts (redeems) tokens back into BCH.  You must be the owner of this group (have the ability to sign the controllingAddress) to successfully execute this function. Some wallets may require that tokens first be sent to the controllingAddress before melting.  This allows you to control which tokens are melted.

**Syntax:**

`token melt <group id> <address> <quantity> [ <address> <quantity>...]`

**Returns:**

A transaction id (hex string).

**Example:**

```bash
./bitcoin-cli token melt bchreg:zzm4ufz5erpzphtxm5knllxyv9kwut8vnsjjrsfg48 bchreg:qz52hzhqdlfrvwsrt74kf6rt5utzvf5zsv4hdywqxd 100
9ef6465c47b620507fb99937b9df836820f2b103f9cf1b94be532865f7751757
```


#### Token Description Document

Additional data **MAY** be placed in an OP_RETURN output and included in a transaction containing a mint operation.  This information **MAY** be used by wallets to provide a more user-friendly interface, and to provide additional information to users, including legal documents.

This data should only be placed in a transaction that mints tokens to a single group.  Otherwise which group the OP_RETURN data applies to is ambiguous, and should be ignored by wallets. *[we could allow multiple pieces of data in OP_RETURN and use a canonical ordering, but this is just the sort of little-used detail that many wallets won't implement.  Its better to keep it simple]*
This data should only be included in one (presumably, but not necessarily, the first) transaction.  Light wallets looking for information on a particular group can be provided with it via a SPV proof of the inclusion of the data-bearing transaction.

The contents of the OP_RETURN output are defined as null separated strings:

`<ticker> <0> <name> <0> <uri> <0> <double SHA256 of dictionary in the uri json document (see below)>`

It is possible to have an empty field.  For example,

`MYCOIN\0\0http://www.mycoin.com/info`

The `<URI>` field supports http and https protocols and references an "application/json" type document in [I-JSON format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7493) with fields defined as follows:

```json
[{
  "ticker": "string, required",
  "name": "string, optional",
  "summary": "string, optional",
  "description": "string, optional",
  "legal": "string, optional",
  "creator": "string, optional",
  "contact": { "method": "string, optional", "method2": "string, optional" }
 },
"<signature>"]
```

**signature**: The signature field contains the signature of the preceding dictionary using the group identifier, from open brace to close brace inclusive.  Validators must check this signature against the exact bytes of the document so that spacing is not changed. **[DISCUSSION: how hard is this to implement in various languages?  Is there a better way?]**   The signature algorithm is what is implemented in the Satoshi client's "signmessage" RPC function.  The following description is informative, not authorative:
* Compute the message hash by using the double SHA-256 of the string "Bitcoin Signed Message:\n" + message
* Create a compact ECDSA signature
* Convert to text using base 64 encoding with the following charset: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/"
*[Wallets and users use this signature to show that the creator of the token is affirming the information in this json document.  And this signature also proves that this document and URL is associated with this group.  By hosting this document, the owner of a domain name is associated with this token.  It is recommended that token issuers use https for the uri so man-in-the-middle attacks cannot be used to make it look like your domain is hosting a token description document]*

**ticker**: Short token name.  Should be 6 characters or less

**name**: Full token name

**summary**: Paragraph description

**description**: Full description

**legal**: Full legal contract between users of this token and the creator, if applicable. **[DISCUSSION: should we allow markdown syntax?]**

**creator**: Who created this token

**contact**: Optional contact information for the creator, for example:

  "contact": { "email": "satoshin@gmx.com" }
  
  Defined methods are: "address", "email", "phone", "twitter.com", "facebook.com"
  
  Authors may add their own methods.  If its a web-enabled service, use the domain name to identify the method.  If its a URI protocol, use the protocol name including the final colon (e.g. "http:": "//www.mywebsite.com/contactform")

Authors may add additional fields not defined in this document to the initial dictionary.

#### Illegal ticker names

If a token claims the following ticker names, it is strongly recommended that wallets refuse to display the ticker and instead use "???":

BCH, mBCH, uBCH

If a token claims the following ticker names, it is recommended that wallets refuse to display the ticker and instead use "???":

Any ISO4217 currency code, any NYSE ticker, any NASDAQ ticker, any symbol from your locale's national securities exchange, other popular crypto-currencies.


*[If 3rd party company or individual is creating "representative tokens" their ticker should reflect that.]*

*[Since it is possible to allow actual currency and securities to be issued on the bitcoin cash blockchain and we should reserve the nationally and internationally known ticker symbols for this future use.  Doing so securely is likely not hard.  By accessing the token description document via a URL, we already have a binding between the token and a domain name secured by SSL Certificates.  All that remains is to bind the domain name to a ticker.  Since this is a relatively small amount of slowly changing information, it could simply be a data file in the wallet]*
